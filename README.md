# Eat Da Burger
A burger logger developed using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). An MVC design pattern was followed using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## About The Project

* Eat Da Burger is a restaurant app that allows users to input the names of burgers they would like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger beneath an `I'm hungry! Gimme burgers!` heading of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `DEVOUR IT!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move beneath the `Burgers that I devoured!` heading of the page.

* The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.

Because this application cannot be deployed on GitHub, a walkthrough video demonstrates its functionality below. The deployed app can be found on [Heroku](https://PLACEHOLDER/).
